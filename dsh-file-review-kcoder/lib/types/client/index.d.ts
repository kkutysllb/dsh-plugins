/**
 * File-review-tab plugin, browser half: TWO coexisting surfaces over the same
 * produced-file vocabulary —
 *
 * 1. the chat turn-tail row (the original dsh-file-review card: "Edited N
 *    files · +M -K / Undo / Review"), registered into the
 *    'conversation.chat.turnTail' chain at priority -2 so it claims the chain
 *    BEFORE dsh-coding-sidebar's own -1 interception row (chain election is
 *    first-claim-wins: exactly one row ever renders, never both). Since dsh
 *    0.1.2-alpha.1 the per-turn produced paths come from the BUILT-IN
 *    ui-deliverables plugin (which owns the `deliverables` Definition and its
 *    turn Location data — this plugin registers no Definition of its own, a
 *    second `deliverables` kind would collide with and crash the built-in);
 *    the card's diff stats and undo ride the session derive (session-changes
 *    argument-contract reconstruction); and
 * 2. the 'file-review' better-sidebar tab (per-session change list + inline
 *    red/green diffs + per-turn/per-file undo).
 *
 * The Host half's undo/redo capability reaches both surfaces through the
 * package's Typert remote contribution, mounted here exactly like
 * dsh-file-review did. Every registration is wrapped in ctx.effect so fiber
 * disposal (HMR / plugin disable) unregisters cleanly.
